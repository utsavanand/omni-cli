## Installation

### Prerequisites

Omni CLI is a **lightweight wrapper** - you need to install AI providers first:

#### Required:
- **Node.js 16+** - For omni-cli installation
- **Python 3.9+** - Runtime requirement

#### AI Providers (Install at least one):

**Claude Code** (Recommended):
```bash
# Download from https://claude.ai/download
# Or install via npm (if available)
```
[Installation Guide →](https://claude.ai/download)

**OpenAI/Codex CLI**:
```bash
# Installation instructions at OpenAI's docs
```
[Installation Guide →](https://platform.openai.com/docs)

**Google Gemini CLI**:
```bash
# Installation instructions at Google AI
```
[Installation Guide →](https://ai.google.dev/)

> **Note**: Omni CLI will detect which providers you have installed and make them available automatically. You don't need all of them - just install the ones you want to use!

### Install Omni CLI

**Option 1: From npm** (once published):
```bash
npm install -g omni-cli

# Run setup wizard to check providers
omni --setup
```

**Option 2: Local Development**

Since this package is not yet published to npm, install it locally:

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/omni-cli

# Install dependencies (automatically installs Python deps too)
npm install

# Link the package globally for local testing
npm link

# Or run directly without linking
node bin/omni
```

> **Note**: `npm install` automatically runs the setup script which installs Python dependencies. No need to run `pip install` separately!

### Verify Installation

Run the setup wizard to check which providers are detected:

```bash
omni --setup
```

Output example:
```

Installed providers: claude, codex
Current provider: claude

# Just type to chat
omni> how do I reverse a string in python?

# Switch providers anytime

## Usage

### Multi-Provider Chat (The Killer Feature!)

```bash
$ omni
omni> explain async/await in JavaScript
Thinking (claude)...
[Claude's explanation...]

omni> /use codex
Switched to codex

omni> can you give me a code example?
Thinking (codex)...
# Codex sees Claude's explanation and builds on it!
[Codex's code example...]

omni> /use gemini
Switched to gemini

omni> any performance tips?
Thinking (gemini)...
# Gemini sees the full conversation from both Claude and Codex!
[Gemini's performance advice...]
```

### Consult Multiple Providers (Get Best of Both!)

```bash
$ omni
omni> /consult codex explain the difference between async and defer in JavaScript

💭 Consulting claude and codex...

Merged Response:
[Combined insights from both Claude and Codex, highlighting different perspectives
and providing a comprehensive answer that synthesizes both responses]

─── Individual Responses ───
claude: Async and defer are both attributes for <script> tags that control...
codex: The key difference is timing: async downloads in parallel and executes...
```

The `/consult` command:
- Sends your question to BOTH your current provider and the specified provider
- Collects both responses
- Uses your current provider to synthesize a merged answer
- Shows you both individual responses for comparison
- Perfect for complex questions where you want multiple perspectives!
